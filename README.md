# 🛡️ Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

This repository contains an experimental Intrusion Detection System (IDS) project built using machine learning techniques.  
The goal of this project is to detect malicious network activity and distinguish it from normal traffic using the **NSL-KDD dataset**.

---

## 📂 Repository Contents

- **ZeroDay.ipynb** → Jupyter notebook with the full code, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **nsl-kdd.rar** → Compressed dataset file (NSL-KDD) used for training and testing the IDS.

---

## ✨ Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering on the NSL-KDD dataset  
- Machine learning–based intrusion detection pipeline  
- Model evaluation with accuracy and other performance metrics  
- Notebook format for easy exploration and reproducibility

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/acexedo/intrusion-detection-system.git
cd intrusion-detection-system

### 2. Extract the dataset

Unzip nsl-kdd.rar into the project directory before running the notebook.
(You can use WinRAR or the unrar tool on Linux.)

### 3. Open the notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and open: 
> jupyter notebook ZeroDay.ipynb

## 🛠️ Requirements

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook

You can install dependencies with:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the NSL-KDD dataset
, a refined version of the KDD Cup 1999 dataset widely used in network intrusion detection research.
The dataset contains normal traffic and a variety of attack categories (DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R).
